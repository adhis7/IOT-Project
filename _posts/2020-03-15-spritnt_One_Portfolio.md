<p>I can able to add pin as well as the antenna in Feather M0 board by soldering. </p>
<h1> Problem I Face</h1>
<p>This is my first class of IoT, so I have no basic idea of how to play with a sensor device, how to connect with the TTN server,
    how to assemble all the things to develop room sensors. It was hard for me. Besides this, almost 3 weeks I cannot get access to git lab account,
    so it has somehow difficult me to do the project. Everything is new to me, so I am struggling with my problem.
    Furthermore, I had face problems connecting a device to the TTN server.</p>
<h1>What I Learn</h1>
<P>Now, I am a bit familiar with the Internet of Things equipment. I come to know how the device relates to the TTN server, how it works. </P>
