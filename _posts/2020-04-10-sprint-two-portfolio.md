<h1>Sprint 2</h1>
<B>Noise Level Graph</B>
<p>To display noise level line graph, I used Laravel framework. </p>
<h2>Problem I Face</h2>
<P>While doing this task, it is difficult for me to convert to convert base64 form. The Noise Monitoring Sensor receive the data and stored that data by encrypting base64 data form. So, I need to convert that data into integer form and display in a graph form. so, it is tricky, finally I did it. And another thing, I made an indexing table to display total count, highest value, lowest value, average value of graph. Highest value and lowest value is din not seen in index table so I face a problem in there. Finally, when I convert tat base64 value into integer it starts to work and start to calculate highest and lowest value in indexing table. </p>
<h2>What I learn</h2>
<p>I had got a chance how to implement google chart to demonstrate statistical data in graph. </p>
